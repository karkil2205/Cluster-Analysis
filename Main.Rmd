# Definition of a distance

* A distance function or a metric on $\mathbb{R}^n,\:n\geq 1$, is a function $d:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
* A distance function must satisfy some required properties or axioms. 
* There are three main axioms.
* A1. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= 0\iff \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}$ (identity of indiscernibles);
* A2. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= d(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})$ (symmetry);

* A3. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\leq d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+d(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$  (triangle inequality),
where $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,\cdots,y_n)$ and $\mathbf{z}=(z_1,\cdots,z_n)$ are all vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
* We should use the term _dissimilarity_ rather than _distance_ when not all the three axioms A1-A3 are valid.
* Most of the time, we shall use, with some abuse of vocabulary, the term distance.

# Exercice 1

* Prove that the three axioms A1-A3 imply the non-negativity condition: $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\geq 0.$$


# Euclidean distance


* It is defined by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}.$$

* A1-A2 are onbvious.
* The proof of A3 is provided below.

# Exercice 2

* Is the squared Euclidian distance a true distance?

# Manhattan distance

* The Manhattan distance also called  taxi-cab metric or city-block metric is defined by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})
=\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|.
$$

* A1-A2 hold.
* A3 also holds using the fact that $|a+b|\leq |a|+|b|$ for any reals $a,b$.
* There exists also a weighted version  of the Manhattan distance called the Canberra distance.

y = c(6,6)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "euclidian")
6*sqrt(2)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "manhattan")
```


# Canberra distance

* It is defined by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})
=\sum_{i=1}^n
 \frac{|x_i-y_i|}{|x_i|+|y_i|}.$$

* Note that the term $|x_i- − y_i|/(|x_i|+|y_i|)$ is not properly defined as:when $x_i=y_i=0$.
* By convention we set the ratio to be zero in that case.
* The Canberra distance is specially sensitive to small changes near zero.

x = c(0, 0)
y = c(6,6)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "canberra")
6/6+6/6
```


# Exercice 32

* Prove that the Canberra distance is a true distance.

# Minkowski distance
* Both the Euclidian and the Manattan distances are special cases of  the Minkowski distance which is defined, for $p\geq 1$, by: 
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
\left[\sum_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
 * For $p=1$, we get the Manhattan distance.
 * For $p=2$, we get the Euclidian distance.
* Let us also define: 
$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_p\equiv\left[\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p},$$
where $\|\mathbf{\cdot}\|_p$ is known as the $p$-norm or Minkowski norm.
* Note that the Minkowski distance and norm are related by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_p.
$$
* Conversely, we have:
$$
\|\mathbf{x}\|_p=d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{0}),
$$
where $\mathbf{0}$ is the null-vetor of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
x = c(0, 0)
y = c(6,6)
MinkowDist=c()
for (p in seq(1,30,.01))
{
MinkowDist=c(MinkowDist,dist(rbind(x, y), method = "minkowski", p = p))     
}
ggplot(data =data.frame(x = seq(1,30,.01), y=MinkowDist ) , mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))+geom_point(size=.1,color="red")+xlim(1,11)+xlab("p")+ylab("Minkowski Distance")+ggtitle("Minkowski distance wrt p")
```

# Chebyshev distance 
* At the limit, we get the Chebyshev distance which is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\max_{i=1,\cdots,n}(|x_i-y_i|)=\lim_{p\rightarrow\infty}
\left[\sum_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
* The corresponding norm is:
$$
\|\mathbf{x}|_\infty=\max_{i=1,\cdots,n}(|x_i|).
$$

# Minkowski inequality

* The proof of the triangular inequality A3 is based on the Minkowski inequality:
* For any nonnegative real numbers $a_1,\cdots,a_n$; $b_1,\cdots,b_n$, and for any $p\geq 1$, we have:
$$
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i+b_i)^{p}\right]^{1/p}\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}
+\left[\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
* To prove that the Minkowski distance satisfies A3, notice that 
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}= \sum_{i=1}^n|(x_i-y_i)+(y_i-z_i)|^{p}.
$$
* Since for any reals $x,y$, we have: $|x+y|\leq |x|+|y|$, and using the fact that $x^p$ is increasing in $x\geq 0$, we obtain:
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}\leq \sum_{i=1}^n(|x_i-y_i|+|y_i-z_i|)^{p}.
$$

* Applying the Minkowski inequality with $a_i=|x_i-y_i|$ and $b_i=|y_i-z_i|$, $i=1,\cdots,n$, we get:
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}\leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right)^{1/p}+\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i-z_i|^{p}\right)^{1/p}.
$$

# Hölder inequality

* The proof of the Minkowski inequality itself requires the Hölder inequality:
* For any nonnegative real numbers $a_1,\cdots,a_n$; $b_1,\cdots,b_n$, and any $p,q>1$ with $1/p+1/q=1$, we have:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^{q}\right]^{1/q}
$$
* The proof of the Hölder inequality relies on the Young inequality:
* For any $a,b>0$, we have
$$
ab\leq \frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q},
$$
with equality occuring iff: $a^p=b^q$. 
* To prove the Young inequality, one can use the (strict) convexity of the exponential function.
* For any reals $x,y$, we have:
$$
e^{\frac{x}{p}+\frac{y}{q} }\leq \frac{e^{x}}{p}+\frac{e^{y}}{q}. 
$$
* We then set: $x=p\ln a$ and $y=q\ln b$ to get the Young inequality.
* A good reference on inequalities is: Z. Cvetkovski,  Inequalities: theorems, techniques and selected problems, 2012, Springer Science & Business Media.
 # Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
* Note that the triangular inequality for the Minkowski distance implies: 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
* Note that for $p=2$, we have $q=2$. The Hölder inequality implies for that special case
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n|x_iy_i|\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}. 
$$
* Since the LHS od thes above inequality is greater then $|\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i|$, we get the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality

$$
|\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i|\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}. 
$$
* Using the dot product notation called also scalar product noation: $\mathbf{x\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i$, and the norm notation $\|\mathbf{\cdot}\|_2 \|$, the Cauchy-Schwart inequality is:
$$
|\mathbf{x\cdot y} | \leq \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \| \mathbf{y}\|_2.
$$

# Pearson correlation distance 

* The Pearson correlation coefficient is a similarity measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by:
$$
\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})(y_i-\bar{\mathbf{y}})}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^2\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{\mathbf{y}})^2}}},
$$
where $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ is the mean of the vector $\mathbf{x}$ defined by: 
$$\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i,$$
* Note that the Pearson correlation coefficient satisfies P2 and  is invariant to any positive linear transformation, i.e.: $$\rho(\alpha\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}),$$ for any $\alpha>0$.
* The Pearson distance (or correlation distance) is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).$$

* Note that the Pearson distance does not satisfy A1 since $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=0$ for any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x}$. It neither satisfies the triangle inequality. However, the symmetry property is fullfilled. 

# Cosine correlation distance

* The cosine of the angle $\theta$ between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is a measure of similarity given by:
$$
\cos(\theta)=\frac{\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|_2\|\mathbf{y}\|_2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}}}.
$$
* Note that the cosine of the angle between the two centred vectors $\mathbf{x}-\bar{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{y}-\bar{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{1}$ coincides with the Pearson correlation coefficient of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of units of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
* The cosine correlation distance is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\cos(\theta).
$$
* It shares similar properties than the Pearson correlation distance. Likewise, Axioms A1 and A3 are not satisfied.

# Spearman correlation distance 

* To calculate the Spearman's rank-order correlation, we need to map seperately each of the vectors to ranked data values: 
$$\mathbf{x}\rightarrow \text{rank}(\mathbf{x})=(x_1^r,\cdots,x_n^r).$$
* Here, $x_i^r$ is the rank of $x_i$ among the set of values of $\mathbf{x}$.
* We illustrate this transformation with a simple example:
* If $\mathbf{x}=(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)$, then the rank-order vector is $\text{rank}(\mathbf{x})=(2,1,3,4,5)$.  

```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
rank(x)
```

* The Spearman's rank correlation of two numerical variables $\mathbf{x}$  and $\mathbf{y}$ is simply the Pearson correlation of the two correspnding rank-order variables $\text{rank}(\mathbf{x})$ and $\text{rank}(\mathbf{y})$, i.e. $\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y}))$. This measure is is useful because it is more robust against outliers than the Pearson correlation.
* If all  the $n$  ranks are distinct, it can be computed using the following formula:
$$
\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y}))=1-\frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)},
$$
where $d_i=x_i^r-y_i^r,\:i=1,\cdots,n$.
 * The spearman distance is then defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y})).
$$
* It can be shown that easaly that it is not a proper distance.
* If all  the $n$  ranks are distinct, we get:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}.
$$

```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
rank(x)
y=c(30,2 , 9, 20, 48)
rank(y)
d=rank(x)-rank(y)
d
cor(rank(x),rank(y))
1-6*sum(d^2)/(5*(5^2-1))
```


# Kendall tau distance 

* The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is calculated from the number of correspondances between the rankings of $\mathbf{x}$ and the rankings of $\mathbf{y}$.
*   The number of pairs of observations among $n$ observations or values is: 
$${n \choose 2} =\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$
* The pairs of observations $(x_{i},x_{j})$  and  $(y_{i},y_{j})$ are said to be _concordant_ if: $$\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)=\text{sign}(y_j-y_i),$$ and to be _discordant_ if:  $$\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)=-\text{sign}(y_j-y_i),$$
where $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ returns  $1$ for positive numbers and  $-1$ negative numbers and $0$ otherwise.
* If $x_i=x_j$ or $y_i=y_j$ (or both), there is a tie.
* The Kendall $\tau$ coefficient is defined by (neglecting ties):
$$\tau =\frac {1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^n\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)\text{sign}(y_j-y_i).$$
* Let $n_c$ (resp. $n_d$) be the number of concordant (resp. discordant) pairs, we have $$\tau =\frac {2(n_c-n_d)}{n(n-1)}.$$ 
* The Kendall tau distance is then: $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\tau. $$
* Remark: the triangular inequality may fail in cases where there are ties.

```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
y=c(30,2 , 9, 20, 48)
tau=0
for (i in 1:5)
{  
tau=tau+sign(x -x[i])%*%sign(y -y[i])
}
tau=tau/(5*4)
tau
cor(x,y, method="kendall")
```

# Variables standardization

* Variables are often standardized before measuring dissimilarities.
* Standardization converts the original variables into uniteless variables.
* A well known method is the z-score transformation: 
$$
\mathbf{x}\rightarrow (\frac{x_1-\bar{\mathbf{x}}}{s_\mathbf{x}},\cdots,\frac{x_n-\bar{\mathbf{x}}}{s_\mathbf{x}}),
$$ 
where $s_\mathbf{x}$ is the sample standard deviation given by:
$$
s_\mathbf{x}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^2.
$$
* The transformed variable will have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.
* The result obtained with Pearson correlation measures and standardized Euclidean distances are comparable.
* For other methods, see: Milligan, G. W., & Cooper, M. C. (1988). A study of standardization of variables in cluster analysis. _Journal of classification_, _5_(2), 181-204.

```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
y=c(30,2 , 9, 20, 48)
(x-mean(x))/sd(x)
scale(x)
(y-mean(y))/sd(y)
scale(y)
```

# Similarity measures for binary data
* A common simple situation occurs when all information is of the presence/absence of 2-level qualitative characters.
* We assume there are $n$ characters.
* *The presence of the character is coded by $1$ and the absence by 0. 
* We have have at our disposal two vectors.
* $\mathbf{x}$ is observed for a first individual (or object).
* $\mathbf{y}$ is observed for a second individual. 
* We can then calculate the following four statistics:
 
   $a=\mathbf{x\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i.$
   
   $b=\mathbf{x\cdot (1-y)}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(1-y_i).$
   
   $c=\mathbf{(1-x)\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^n(1-x_i)y_i.$

   $d=\mathbf{(1-x)\cdot (1-y)}=\sum_{i=1}^n(1-x_i)(1-y_i).$

* The counts of  matches are $a$ for $(1,1)$ and $d$ for $(0,0)$;
* The counts of mismatches are $b$ for $(1,0)$ and $c$ for $(0,1)$.
* Note that obviously: $a+b+c+d= n$.
* This gives a very useful $2 \times 2$ association table.

* The data shows $8$ people (individuals) and $10$ binary variables:
* Sex, Married, Fair Hair, Blue Eyes, Wears Glasses, Round Face, Pessimist, Evening Type, Is an Only Child, Left-Handed.

row.names(data)=c("Ilan","Jacqueline","Kim","Lieve","Leon","Peter","Talia","Tina")
names(data)=c("Sex", "Married", "Fair Hair", "Blue Eyes", "Wears Glasses", "Round Face", "Pessimist", "Evening Type", "Is an Only Child", "Left-Handed")
```

* We are comparing the records for Ilan with Talia.
```{r,echo=T,results='asis'}
x=data["Ilan",]
y=data["Talia",]
knitr::kable(table(x, y)[2:1,2:1],"pipe")
```

* Therefore: $a = 1,\:b = 3,\: c = 1,\: d = 5$.
* Note that interchanging Ilan and Talia would permute $b$ and $c$ while leaving $a$ and $d$ unchanged.
* A good similarity or dissimilarity coefficient must treat $b$ and $c$ symmetrically.
* A similarity measure is denoted by: $s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$.
* The corresponding distance is then defined as: 
 $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).$$
* Alternatively, we have:
$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sqrt{1-s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}.$$ 
* A list of some of the similarity measures $s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ that have been suggested for binary data is shown below.
* A more extensive list can be found in: Gower, J. C., & Legendre, P. (1986). Metric and Euclidean properties of dissimilarity coefficients. _Journal of classification_, _3_(1), 5-48.

|Gower and Legendre (1986)|$\frac{2a}{2a+b+c}$|$\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c}$|

* To calculate these coefficients, we use the function: [dist.binary().](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ade4/versions/1.7-16/topics/dist.binary)

* All the distances  in this package are of type  $d(\mathbf{x}.\mathbf{y})= \sqrt{1 - s(\mathbf{x}.\mathbf{y})}$.

```{r,echo=T,results='asis'}
library(ade4)
a=1
b=3
c=1
d=5
dist.binary(data[c("Ilan","Talia"),],method=2)^2
1-(a+d )/(a+b+c+d)
dist.binary(data[c("Ilan","Talia"),],method=1)^2
1-a/(a+b+c)
dist.binary(data[c("Ilan","Talia"),],method=4)^2
1-(a+d )/(a+2*(b+c)+d)
# One Gower coefficient is missing
dist.binary(data[c("Ilan","Talia"),],method=5)^2
1-2*a/(2*a+b+c)
```
* The reason for such a large number of possible measures has to do with the apparent uncertainty as to how to deal with the count of zero-zero matches $d$.
* The measues embedding $d$ are sometimes called symmetrical.
* The other measues are called assymmetrical.
* In some cases, of course, zero_zero matches are completely equivalent to one–one matches, and therefore should be included in the calculated similarity measure.
* An example is gender, where there is no preference as to which of the two categories should be coded zero or one.
* But in other cases the inclusion or otherwise of $d$ is more problematic; for example, when the zero category corresponds to the genuine absence of some property, such as wings in a study of insects. 
# Exercice 4
* Prove that the distances based on the  SimplemMatching coefficient and the Jaccard coefficient satisfy A3.
* Prove that the distances proposed by Gower and Legendre (1986) do not satisfy A3.
* Hint: Proofs and counterexamples have to be adapted from in the paper: 
* [Gower, J. C., & Legendre, P. (1986). Metric and Euclidean properties of dissimilarity coefficients. _Journal of classification_, _3_(1), 5-48.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUQ7g9HIwwUG0CXbCsLA03hnApWMhjka/view?usp=drivesdk)

# Nominal variables 

* We previuosly studied above binary variables which can only take on two states coded as $0,1$.
* We generalize this approach to nominal variables which may take on more than two states.
* Eye's color may have for example four states: blue, brown, green, grey . 
* Le $M$ be the number of states and code the outcomes as $1, \cdots, M$. 
* We could choose $1 =\text{blue},$ $2 =\text{brown},$ $3 =\text{green},$ and $4 =\text{grey}$.
* These states are not ordered in any way
* One strategy would be creating a new binary variable for each of the $M$ nominal states.
* Then to put it equal to $1$ if the corresponding state occurs and to $0$ otherwise. 
* After that, one could resort to one of the dissimilarity coeffi-
cients of the previous subsection. 
* The most common way of measuring the similarity or dissimilarity between two objects through categorial variables is the simple matching approach. 
* If $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},$ are both $n$ nominal records for two individuals,
* Let define the function: 
$$\delta(x_i,y_i)\equiv \begin{cases}0,
\text{ if } x_i=y_i;\\1,\text{ if } x_i \neq y_i.\end{cases}$$

* Let  $N_{a+d}$ be the number of attributes of the two individuals on which the two records match:
$$N_{a+d}=\sum_{i=1}^n\delta(x_i,y_i).$$
* Let $N_{b+c}$ be the number of attributes on which the two records do not match:
$$N_{b+c}= n - N_{a+d}.$$
* Let $N_d$ be the number of attributes on which the two records match in a “not applicable” category:
  $$N_{d}=\sum_{i=1}^n\delta(x_i,y_i).$$

* The distance corresponding to the simple matching approach is: 
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\delta(x_i,y_i)}{n}.
$$
* Therefore:
$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{N_{a+d}}{N_{a+d}+N_{b+c}}.$$
*  Note that simple matching has exactly the same meaning as in the preceding section.
 
# Gower’s dissimilarity
* Gower’s coefficient is a dissimilarity measure specifically
designed for handling mixed attribute types or variables.
* See: GOWER, John C. A general coefficient of similarity and some of its properties. _Biometrics_, 1971, p. 857-871.
* The coefficient is calculated as the weighted average of attribute contributions.
* Weights usually used only to indicate which attribute values could actually be compared meaningfully.
* The formula is:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \delta(x_i,y_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}.
$$
* The wheight $w_i$  is put equal to $1$ when both measurements $x_i$ and $y_i$ are nonmissing, 
* The number $\delta(x_i,y_i)$ is the contribution of the $i$th measure or variable to the dissimilarity measure.
* It the $i$th measure is nominal, we take  
$$
\delta(x_i,y_i)\equiv \begin{cases}0,
\text{ if } x_i=y_i;\\1,\text{ if } x_i \neq y_i.\end{cases}
$$
*  If the $i$th measure is  interval-scaled, we take instead: 
$$
\delta(x_i,y_i)\equiv \frac{|x_i-y_i|}{R_i},
$$
where $R_i$ is the range of variable $i$ over the available data.
* Consider the following data set:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karkil2205/Usid13Chapter1/master/Table35.jpg)
*Data from Everitt, B. S., Landau, S., Leese, M., & Stahl, D. (2011). Cluster Analysis. –John Wiley & Sons. Ltd., New York, 330.*

* The records of 11 students including one that had not yet experienced video games (subject 82) are shown in Table 3.5. 
* The dissimilarity between subjects 1 and 2 can be calculated as follows

$$\frac{0+|2-0|/30+|2-2|/3+0+|2-3|/3+1+0}{7}=0.2.$$

* The variables *like* and *freq* have been treated as ordinal variables, as if their ranks were on an interval scale.
*  This is not ideal but seemed preferable to treating them as nominal variables.

# Distance matrix computation
* We’ll use a subset of the data USArrests
*  We’ll use only a by taking 15 random rows among the 50 rows in the data set. 
* Next, we standardize the data using the function scale():

```{r}
install.packages("FactoMineR")
library("FactoMineR")
data("USArrests") # Loading
head(USArrests, 3) # Print the first 3 rows
set.seed(123)
ss <- sample(1:50, 15) # Take 15 random rows
df <- USArrests[ss, ] # Subset the 15 rows
df.scaled <- scale(df) # Standardize the variables
```
