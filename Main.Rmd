# Definition of a distance


* A distance function or a metric on $\mathbb{R}^n,\:n\geq 1$, is a function $d:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
* A distance function must satisfy some required properties or axioms. 
* There are three main axioms.
* A1. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= 0\iff \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}$ (identity of indiscernibles);
* A2. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= d(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})$ (symmetry);

* A3. $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\leq d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+d(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$  (triangle inequality),
where $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,\cdots,y_n)$ and $\mathbf{z}=(z_1,\cdots,z_n)$ are all vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
* We should use the term _dissimilarity_ rather than _distance_ when not all the three axioms A1-A3 are valid.
* Most of the time, we shall use, with some abuse of vocabulary, the term distance.



# Exercice 1

* Prove that the three axioms A1-A3 imply the non-negativity condition: $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\geq 0.$$



# Euclidean distance

* It is defined by:

$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}.
$$

* A1-A2 are obvious.
* The proof of A3 is provided below.

# Exercice 2

* Is the squared Euclidian distance a true distance?

# Manhattan distance

* The Manhattan distance also called  taxi-cab metric or city-block metric is defined by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})
=\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|.$$

* A1-A2 hold.
* A3 also holds using the fact that $|a+b|\leq |a|+|b|$ for any reals $a,b$.
* There exists also a weighted version  of the Manhattan distance called the Canberra distance.

![](Manhattan.jpg)

```{r}
x = c(0, 0)
y = c(6,6)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "euclidian")
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "euclidian",diag=T,upper=T)
6*sqrt(2)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "manhattan")
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "manhattan",diag=T,upper=T)

```

# Canberra distance

* It is defined by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})
=\sum_{i=1}^n
 \frac{|x_i-y_i|}{|x_i|+|y_i|}.$$

* Note that the term $|x_i-y_i|/(|x_i|+|y_i|)$ is not properly defined as: $x_i=y_i=0$.
* By convention we set that term to be zero in that case.
* The Canberra distance is specially sensitive to small changes near zero.

```{r}
x = c(0, 0)
y = c(6,6)
dist(rbind(x, y), method = "canberra")
6/6+6/6
```

# Exercice 3

* Prove that the Canberra distance is a true distance, i.e. that it satisfies A1-A3.

# Minkowski distance
* Both the Euclidian and the Manattan distances are special cases of  the Minkowski distance which is defined, for $p\geq 1$, by: 
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
\left[\sum_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
 * For $p=1$, we get the Manhattan distance.
 * For $p=2$, we get the Euclidian distance.
* Let us also define: 
$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_p\equiv\left[\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p},$$
where $\|\mathbf{\cdot}\|_p$ is known as the $p$-norm or Minkowski norm.
* Note that the Minkowski distance and norm are related by:

$$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_p.$$

* Conversely, we have:

$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_p=d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{0}),$$

where 
$\mathbf{0}$ is the null-vetor of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
x = c(0, 0)
y = c(6,6)
MinkowDist=c() # Initialiser à vide la liste
for (p in seq(1,30,.01))
{
MinkowDist=c(MinkowDist,dist(rbind(x, y), method = "minkowski", p = p))     
}

ggplot(data =data.frame(x = seq(1,30,.01), y=MinkowDist ) , mapping = aes( x=x, y= y))+
  geom_point(size=.1,color="red")+
  xlab("p")+ylab("Minkowski Distance")+ggtitle("Minkowski distance wrt p")
```

# Exercice 4

Produce a similar graph using "The Economist" theme. Indicate on the graph the Manhattan, the Euclidian distances as well as the Chebyshev distance introduced below.

# Chebyshev distance 

* At the limit, we get the Chebyshev distance which is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\max_{i=1,\cdots,n}(|x_i-y_i|)=\lim_{p\rightarrow\infty}
\left[\sum_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$

* The corresponding norm is:

$$
\|\mathbf{x}\|_\infty=\max_{i=1,\cdots,n}(|x_i|).
$$

# Minkowski inequality

* The proof of the triangular inequality A3 is based on the Minkowski inequality:
* For any nonnegative real numbers $a_1,\cdots,a_n$; $b_1,\cdots,b_n$, and for any $p\geq 1$, we have:
$$
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i+b_i)^{p}\right]^{1/p}\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}
+\left[\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
* To prove that the Minkowski distance satisfies A3, notice that 
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}= \sum_{i=1}^n|(x_i-y_i)+(y_i-z_i)|^{p}.
$$
* Since for any reals $x,y$, we have: $|x+y|\leq |x|+|y|$, and using the fact that $x^p$ is increasing in $x\geq 0$, we obtain:
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}\leq \sum_{i=1}^n(|x_i-y_i|+|y_i-z_i|)^{p}.
$$

* Applying the Minkowski inequality with $a_i=|x_i-y_i|$ and $b_i=|y_i-z_i|$, $i=1,\cdots,n$, we get:
$$
 \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-z_i|^{p}\leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^{p}\right)^{1/p}+\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i-z_i|^{p}\right)^{1/p}.
$$

# Exercice 5
To illustrate the Minkowski inequality, draw $100$ times two lists of $100$ draws from the lognormal distribution with mean $1600$ and standard-deviation $300$. Illustrate with a graph the gap between the two drawn lists.

# Hölder inequality

* The proof of the Minkowski inequality itself requires the Hölder inequality:
* For any nonnegative real numbers $a_1,\cdots,a_n$; $b_1,\cdots,b_n$, and any $p,q>1$ with $1/p+1/q=1$, we have:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{p}\right]^{1/p}
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^{q}\right]^{1/q}
$$
* The proof of the Hölder inequality relies on the Young inequality:
* For any $a,b>0$, we have
$$
ab\leq \frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q},
$$
with equality occuring iff: $a^p=b^q$. 
* To prove the Young inequality, one can use the (strict) convexity of the exponential function.
* For any reals $x,y$, we have:
$$
e^{\frac{x}{p}+\frac{y}{q} }\leq \frac{e^{x}}{p}+\frac{e^{y}}{q}. 
$$
* We then set: $x=p\ln a$ and $y=q\ln b$ to get the Young inequality.
* A good reference on inequalities is: [Z. Cvetkovski,  Inequalities: theorems, techniques and selected problems, 2012, Springer Science & Business Media](https://book4you.org/book/1228394/3ec0fb).

 # Cauchy-Schwartz inequality

* Note that the triangular inequality for the Minkowski distance implies: 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|\leq
\left[\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^{p}\right]^{1/p}.
$$
* Note that for $p=2$, we have $q=2$. The Hölder inequality implies for that special case
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n|x_iy_i|\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}. 
$$
* Since the LHS od thes above inequality is greater then $|\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i|$, we get the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
$$
|\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i|\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}. 
$$
* Using the dot product notation called also scalar product notation: $\mathbf{x\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i$, and the norm notation $\|\mathbf{\cdot}\|_2$, the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality is:
$$
|\mathbf{x\cdot y} | \leq \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \| \mathbf{y}\|_2.
$$


# Pearson correlation distance 

* The Pearson correlation coefficient is a similarity measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by:
$$
\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})(y_i-\bar{\mathbf{y}})}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^2\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{\mathbf{y}})^2}}},
$$
where $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ is the mean of the vector $\mathbf{x}$ defined by: 
$$\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i,$$
* Note that the Pearson correlation coefficient satisfies P2 and  is invariant to any positive linear transformation, i.e.: $$\rho(\alpha\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}),$$ for any $\alpha>0$.
* The Pearson distance (or correlation distance) is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\rho(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).
$$

* Note that the Pearson distance does not satisfy A1 since $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=0$ for any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x}$. It neither satisfies the triangle inequality. However, the symmetry property is fullfilled. 

# Cosine correlation distance


* The cosine of the angle $\theta$ between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is a measure of similarity given by:
$$
\cos(\theta)=\frac{\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|_2\|\mathbf{y}\|_2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}}}.
$$
* Note that the cosine of the angle between the two centred vectors $\mathbf{x}-\bar{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{y}-\bar{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{1}$ coincides with the Pearson correlation coefficient of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of units of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
* The cosine correlation distance is defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\cos(\theta).
$$
* It shares similar properties than the Pearson correlation distance. Likewise, Axioms A1 and A3 are not satisfied.




# Spearman correlation distance 

* To calculate the Spearman's rank-order correlation, we need to map seperately each of the vectors to ranked data values: 
$$\mathbf{x}\rightarrow \text{rank}(\mathbf{x})=(x_1^r,\cdots,x_n^r).$$
* Here, $x_i^r$ is the rank of $x_i$ among the set of values of $\mathbf{x}$.
* We illustrate this transformation with a simple example:
* If $\mathbf{x}=(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)$, then the rank-order vector is $\text{rank}(\mathbf{x})=(2,1,3,4,5)$.  

```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
rank(x)
```

* The Spearman's rank correlation of two numerical variables $\mathbf{x}$  and $\mathbf{y}$ is simply the Pearson correlation of the two correspnding rank-order variables $\text{rank}(\mathbf{x})$ and $\text{rank}(\mathbf{y})$, i.e. $\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y}))$. This measure is is useful because it is more robust against outliers than the Pearson correlation.
* If all  the $n$  ranks are distinct, it can be computed using the following formula:
$$
\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y}))=1-\frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)},
$$
where $d_i=x_i^r-y_i^r,\:i=1,\cdots,n$.
 * The spearman distance is then defined by:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\rho(\text{rank}(\mathbf{x}),\text{rank}(\mathbf{y})).
$$
* It can be shown that easaly that it is not a proper distance.
* If all  the $n$  ranks are distinct, we get:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}.
$$





```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
rank(x)
y=c(30,2 , 9, 20, 48)
rank(y)
d=rank(x)-rank(y)
d
cor(rank(x),rank(y))
1-6*sum(d^2)/(5*(5^2-1))
```


# Exercice 6
* For the two vectors $\mathbf{x}=(22,34,1,12,25,56,7)$ and $\mathbf{y}=(2,64,12,2,22,5,8)$ :
* Calculate the ranks for each vector.
* Deduce the Spearman correlation distance from that ranks.
* Deduce the Spearman correlation distance from the above dispalyed alternative equation.
* Calculate the Spearman correlation distance using the **R** function. 

# Kendall tau distance 

* The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is calculated from the number of correspondances between the rankings of $\mathbf{x}$ and the rankings of $\mathbf{y}$.
*   The number of pairs of observations among $n$ observations or values is: 
$${n \choose 2} =\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$
* The pairs of observations $(x_{i},x_{j})$  and  $(y_{i},y_{j})$ are said to be _concordant_ if: $$\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)=\text{sign}(y_j-y_i),$$ and to be _discordant_ if:  $$\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)=-\text{sign}(y_j-y_i),$$
where $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ returns  $1$ for positive numbers and  $-1$ negative numbers and $0$ otherwise.
* If $x_i=x_j$ or $y_i=y_j$ (or both), there is a tie.
* The Kendall $\tau$ coefficient is defined by (neglecting ties):
$$\tau =\frac {1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^n\text{sign}(x_j-x_i)\text{sign}(y_j-y_i).$$
* Let $n_c$ (resp. $n_d$) be the number of concordant (resp. discordant) pairs, we have $$\tau =\frac {2(n_c-n_d)}{n(n-1)}.$$ 
* The Kendall tau distance is then: $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1-\tau. $$
* Remark: the triangular inequality may fail in cases where there are ties.



```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 15, 92)
y=c(30,2 , 9, 20, 48)
tau=0
for (i in 1:5)
{  
tau=tau+sign(x -x[i])%*%sign(y -y[i])
}
tau=tau/(5*4)
tau
cor(x,y, method="kendall")
```

# Exercice 7
* For the two vectors $\mathbf{x}=(22,34,1,12,25,56,7)$ and $\mathbf{y}=(2,64,12,2,22,5,8)$ :
* List all pairs of coordinates.
* How many pairs are there?
* For each pair and each cector, compute the signs of the differences in coordinates.
* Deduce the Kendall tau coefficient using the above computations.
* Calculate the Kendall tau coefficient using the R function. 

# Variables standardization

* Variables are often standardized before measuring dissimilarities.
* Standardization converts the original variables into uniteless variables.
* A well known method is the z-score transformation: 
$$
\mathbf{x}\rightarrow (\frac{x_1-\bar{\mathbf{x}}}{s_\mathbf{x}},\cdots,\frac{x_n-\bar{\mathbf{x}}}{s_\mathbf{x}}),
$$ 
where $s_\mathbf{x}$ is the sample standard deviation given by:
$$
s_\mathbf{x}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^2.
$$
* The transformed variable will have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.
* The result obtained with Pearson correlation measures and standardized Euclidean distances are comparable.
* For other methods, see: [Milligan, G. W., & Cooper, M. C. (1988). A study of standardization of variables in cluster analysis. _Journal of classification_, _5_(2), 181-204](https://booksc.org/book/6755563/66358a)

(y-mean(y))/sd(y)

```


# Similarity measures for binary data
* A common simple situation occurs when all information is of the presence/absence of 2-level qualitative characters.
* We assume there are $n$ characters.
* *The presence of the character is coded by $1$ and the absence by 0. 
* We have have at our disposal two vectors.
* $\mathbf{x}$ is observed for a first individual (or object).
* $\mathbf{y}$ is observed for a second individual. 
* We can then calculate the following four statistics:
 
   $a=\mathbf{x\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i.$
   
   $b=\mathbf{x\cdot (1-y)}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(1-y_i).$
   
   $c=\mathbf{(1-x)\cdot y}=\sum_{i=1}^n(1-x_i)y_i.$

   $d=\mathbf{(1-x)\cdot (1-y)}=\sum_{i=1}^n(1-x_i)(1-y_i).$

* The counts of  matches are $a$ for $(1,1)$ and $d$ for $(0,0)$;
* The counts of mismatches are $b$ for $(1,0)$ and $c$ for $(0,1)$.
* Note that obviously: $a+b+c+d= n$.
* This gives a very useful $2 \times 2$ association table.

|**First individual**|1|$a$|$b$|$a+b$|
